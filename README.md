## What This Is

Swarmcrews gives you a spatial interface for orchestrating coding agents:

- **Infinite canvas** — drag, zoom, arrange nodes visually
- **Leader/Minion orchestration** — give a Leader a complex task, and it spawns Minion agents, wires them up, and tracks progress through a live task board
- **Git worktree isolation** — Minions share the Leader's isolated worktree, declared overlapping write scopes are rejected during assignment, and changes route through an explicit approval flow before merging
- **Skills browser** — browse, create, and launch pre-configured skill templates
- **Project management** — persistent projects with SQLite storage, session history, cost tracking
- **Multiple agent harnesses** — use Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, or Pi, with each installed harness exposing its own configured model catalog

## Prerequisites

You need all of the following installed before starting:

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **At least one agent harness** | Claude Code and Codex can use their bundled SDK runtimes. OpenCode and Pi are discovered on `PATH` (or via `OPENCODE_PATH` / `PI_PATH`). Authenticate with the harness itself; Swarmcrews derives model choices from each ready harness. |
| **Node.js ≥ 22** | Required by the agent SDKs and modern runtime features |
| **pnpm** | Package manager (`npm install -g pnpm` if you don't have it) |
| **git** | Used for repository access and optional worktree isolation |
| **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download)** | Optional, for tailnet HTTPS and the mobile companion |

### Verify your setup

```bash
pnpm preflight
```

This checks the host, loopback ports, native dependencies, and every registered
harness runtime. It succeeds when at least one harness is authenticated and
prints controlled remediation for the others.

## Quick Start

**New to Swarmcrews?** Follow the [Getting Started guide](./docs/getting-started.md)
for a complete first-project walkthrough, screenshots, copyable prompts, and
help with Swarmcrews, task graphs, dashboards, context, and reviewing changes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hipsterusername/minions.git swarmcrews
cd swarmcrews
pnpm install
pnpm preflight
pnpm start
```

`pnpm start` launches the backend and Vite together as a background service and
returns the terminal to you immediately. It opens the browser, writes logs to
`.run/swarmcrews.log`, and keeps running until you `pnpm stop`. Use `pnpm status`
to check on it. It never configures Tailscale unless you pass `-- --tailscale`.

If you'd rather run in the foreground and stream logs (stopping both on
`Ctrl-C`), use `pnpm dev` instead.

- Local URL: **http://localhost:6173**

That's it. No environment variables, no database setup, no Docker — SQLite handles storage automatically.

### Independent agent evaluations

The separately installable [`evals/`](./evals/README.md) package validates task
fixtures, plans explicit adapter runs, grades frozen submissions, accounts for
usage coverage, and generates offline performance reports. It is not part of
the Swarmcrews application runtime and does not run during normal app startup.

## Usage

### Leader/Minion Orchestration

1. Click the **+** button on the canvas toolbar and add a **Leader** node
2. Give the Leader a complex task — it plans the work and spawns **Minion** agents
3. Minion nodes appear on the canvas, automatically wired to the Leader
4. Minions run inside the Leader's isolated worktree, so parallel tasks should own disjoint files
5. The Leader tracks progress, integrates results, and routes the shared worktree through approval

> Minion nodes are created and wired automatically — you never need to add or connect them manually.

### Other Node Types

Click **+** on the canvas toolbar to add:

- **Leader** — orchestrator agent that decomposes work and delegates to Minions
- **Markdown** — rich documentation and notes
- **Image** — drop in screenshots or diagrams as canvas context
- **Dashboard** — render DSL component view (also driven by Leader render tools)
- **Context Group** — group nodes together to feed as context into Leader sessions

Folder and File Viewer nodes are created automatically when you drag in directories or files.

## Configuration

All optional — sane defaults are provided:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3141` | Backend server port |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Server bind address; set explicitly for remote binding |
| `VITE_PORT` | `6173` | Vite and Tailscale-facing application port |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_PATH` | SDK discovery | Optional Claude executable override |
| `CODEX_PATH` | SDK discovery | Optional Codex executable override |
| `CODEX_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Codex CLI login | Optional Codex API credentials |
| `SWARMCREWS_HOME` | `~/.swarmcrews` | Central registry, project state, and Swarmcrews-owned worktrees |

Set them as environment variables:

```bash
PORT=8080 pnpm start
```

### Workspace storage and migration

Opening or creating a project explicitly registers its canonical source folder
and assigns it a stable workspace UUID. The UUID is the public identity; the
server owns the mapping to the source folder, so projects on mounted volumes are
supported without treating every path on the host as authorized.

New Swarmcrews state is kept outside the repository:

```text
$SWARMCREWS_HOME/
├── server.db                           # global sessions and orchestration state
├── artifacts/                          # session-scoped generated artifacts
├── recent-projects.json
└── workspaces/
    ├── registry.json                 # UUID → canonical sourceRoot + nickname
    └── <workspace-uuid>/             # stateRoot
        ├── canvas.db
        ├── context.md
        ├── settings.json
        ├── skills.json
        ├── mcp-servers.json
        └── worktrees/                # execution worktrees
```

`SWARMCREWS_HOME` defaults to `~/.swarmcrews` for fresh installs. If that directory
does not exist but `~/.minions` does, Swarmcrews continues using the legacy home.
Explicit `SWARMCREWS_HOME` takes precedence over the supported `MINIONS_HOME`
alias; if both default directories exist, `~/.swarmcrews` wins. Nothing is moved
or merged automatically. See [rebrand compatibility](./docs/rebrand-compatibility.md).
Do not hand-edit `registry.json` or
derive a source path from a UUID. Registration canonicalizes paths and the file
APIs continue to reject traversal and symlink escapes outside the registered
source root.

Existing projects migrate non-destructively:

1. Back up the repository and its existing `.minions/` and
   `.canvas-worktrees/` directories if they contain work you need.
2. Open the existing source folder in Swarmcrews. On first registration, a single
   valid legacy project UUID is preserved; otherwise a UUID is assigned. Regular
   files from `.minions/` are copied into the new UUID state root without
   overwriting destination files or following symlinks.
3. Verify project settings, skills, session history, and pending work. New state
   and new worktrees are created under `$SWARMCREWS_HOME/workspaces/<uuid>/`.
4. Keep the legacy directories until you have completed or discarded old
   worktrees and verified the migrated state. Swarmcrews recognizes legacy
   in-repository worktree paths during the transition and does not
   automatically delete either legacy directory.

Changing `SWARMCREWS_HOME` selects a different registry and state collection. Move
that directory as a unit while Swarmcrews is stopped if you need to relocate it.

Moving a repository does not create new state: explicitly rebind its workspace
UUID to the new source folder (`POST /api/projects/rebind`). A copied repository
gets a new UUID by default. To intentionally make a copy the source for an
existing workspace, use `POST /api/projects/attach`; the replaced binding's
central state is retained and is never deleted implicitly.

Every Leader runs under a durable work item; launches without work-item identity are rejected.
Graph is always enabled for Leaders and is the standard path for executing Minion
assignments. Choose automatic start for safe Graph work or review before start
in the Leader orchestration controls. Leaders can still perform local work themselves.

### Git change mode and execution sandbox

Leader configuration exposes two independent boundaries:

- **Git change mode** chooses whether edits land in a shared checkout or an
  isolated worktree. It is a coordination and review boundary, not an
  operating-system sandbox.
- **Execution sandbox** requests filesystem access (`read-only`,
  `workspace-write`, or explicit `unrestricted`) and approval behavior
  independently. An explicit sandbox policy takes precedence over legacy plan mode; without
  an explicit policy, legacy plan mode defaults to read-only. Normal execution
  defaults to workspace-write.

Full Host has two choices: **Full Host - Leader Only** keeps Minions in their
task sandbox, while **Full Host - Leader + Minions** also grants full host access
to newly launched Minions, including graph tasks. Task-specific approval policies
still apply. Existing saved Full Host settings remain Leader-only. Choose the
scope in project defaults or before launching a new Leader; it persists across
resumes and restarts. Running processes retain their launch policy.

Codex enforces both sandbox axes. Harnesses that cannot enforce an axis
report it as `unmanaged`; Swarmcrews does not claim that Claude, OpenCode, or Pi
enforce these provider-neutral sandbox guarantees. Treat requested policy and
effective policy as different values, and use OS-level isolation when an
unmanaged axis is unacceptable.

Remote browser access is limited to loopback and Tailscale-style hosts
(`100.64.0.0/10`, Tailscale IPv6, and MagicDNS `*.ts.net`). The browser talks to
the backend same-origin — Vite proxies both `/api` and the `/ws` WebSocket to the
server — so changing `PORT` alone is enough; the front end follows automatically:

```bash
PORT=8080 pnpm start
```

### Mobile access over HTTPS (Tailscale)

The mobile companion at `/m` uses **Web Push** for notifications, and browsers
only expose the Service Worker / Push APIs in a **secure context** (HTTPS, or
`localhost`). Opening the app from a phone over `http://<host>:6173` is *not* a
secure context, so the notifications button shows **"Notifications Unsupported"**.

Start the optional background service with tailnet HTTPS:

```bash
pnpm start -- --tailscale
```

Then open `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net:6173/m` on your phone (small screens
auto-redirect to `/m`). Notifications now work: tap **Enable notifications**.

- Stop the background app: `pnpm stop`.
- A local built preview is `pnpm build && pnpm preview` and includes the backend.
- On **iOS**, Web Push additionally requires iOS 16.4+ and adding the app to the
  Home Screen (Share → *Add to Home Screen*), then launching it from that icon.

This stays tailnet-only; it does not enable `tailscale funnel` (public internet)
or claim the bare `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/` origin.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm start` | Start the full stack as a background service on loopback (non-blocking) |
| `pnpm start -- --tailscale` | Start the background service and opt into tailnet HTTPS |
| `pnpm dev` | Foreground backend + frontend development server on loopback (streams logs, `Ctrl-C` to stop) |
| `pnpm preview` | Foreground backend + built frontend preview on loopback |
| `pnpm stop` | Stop the background service |
| `pnpm restart` | Restart the background service |
| `pnpm status` | Report whether the background app is running |
| `pnpm server` | Backend server only |
| `pnpm build` | Production build |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript type checking |
| `pnpm test` | Run vitest in watch mode |
| `pnpm test:run` | Run all unit, contract, and architecture tests once |
| `pnpm test:coverage` | Run the suite once with coverage (used by CI) |
| `pnpm test:smoke` | Run the isolated Echo browser journey without provider credentials |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Run the smoke journey, then the remaining browser tests with graph fixtures |
| `pnpm audit:prod` | Audit production dependencies; fail on high or critical findings |
| `pnpm verify` | Run the full CI gate locally (typechecks, tests, licenses, system model, build) |
| `pnpm preflight` | Validate prerequisites |

## Testing & development workflow

Tests are required for all behavioural changes:

See [Testing strategy](docs/testing-strategy.md) for choosing test boundaries,
reviewing test value, and pruning with explicit surviving-coverage evidence.

1. **Before pushing**, run `pnpm verify` (typechecks, tests, license and system-model checks, build).
   CI runs the same gate and will fail the PR otherwise.
   For an even tighter local loop, install `prek` once
   (`prek install`) — the hook config in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   will run typecheck + tests on every commit.
2. **When refactoring**, preserve tests of observable behavior. If a test
   fails because code moved, a CSS token moved to a stylesheet, or a fixture
   assumes an old lifecycle, repair the test without weakening its behavioral
   contract. Describe actual behavior changes in the PR.
3. **When fixing a bug**, write a failing test first, then make it pass.
   The test stays in the suite.
4. **Test files live next to the code they test** (`src/foo.ts` →
   `src/foo.test.ts`). Cross-tree contract tests live under
   `tests/contracts/`; architecture-fitness tests under
   `tests/architecture/`.

CI collects coverage during the main test run and publishes available reports even
when tests fail; coverage percentages are diagnostic, not a separate threshold.
The smoke server exposes only Echo, while the remaining browser tests also get a
fake Pi runtime for graph recovery. Both use temporary homes and databases. The
smoke journey exercises explicit Git initialization, so its temporary directory
must be outside any Git repository. If your system temp directory is inside one,
use a clean location, for example `TMPDIR=/var/tmp pnpm test:smoke` on Linux.

Assert user-visible outcomes rather than source-file spellings. Layout and
computed-style assertions are appropriate when position, size, visibility, or
readable contrast is the behavior under test; do not remove them to satisfy a
blanket style ban. Browser tests cover actual rendering, which jsdom cannot.

The architecture-fitness suite encodes invariants enforced in CI:
server file size ceilings (≤ 400 lines), no cross-tree imports between
`src/` and `server/`, broadcasts only through `server/bus.ts`, and a
handler registered for every WebSocket command.

## Contributing and security

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the development workflow and
pull-request expectations. Report suspected vulnerabilities privately as
described in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md); do not include credentials, private
repository content, or local transcripts in public issues.

### Harness terms and assumption of risk

Swarmcrews is an independent orchestration layer. It operates through locally
installed and authenticated agent harnesses; it does not provide, resell, or
grant access to their underlying model services. You are responsible for
ensuring that how you install, authenticate, configure, and use each harness
complies with the provider's then-current terms, policies, plan or billing
conditions, and any rules imposed by your organization. Review the
[Anthropic legal terms](https://www.anthropic.com/legal) and
[OpenAI policies](https://openai.com/policies/) that apply to your account and
use case. Swarmcrews does not alter or supersede those terms, and references to
provider products do not imply provider endorsement.

Swarmcrews is provided on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties or conditions of
any kind, as set out in the [Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE). You use Swarmcrews at
your own risk. Coding agents can read and modify files, run commands, create
worktrees, contact configured services, and consume paid provider capacity with
the permissions and credentials you give them. Review permission settings,
protect credentials, keep recoverable backups, and supervise consequential
actions.

Run Swarmcrews only on a trusted local machine or private tailnet. Worktrees are
coordination boundaries, not process sandboxes. Codex can enforce the displayed
filesystem, approval, and network policy; unsupported axes on other harnesses
are explicitly `unmanaged`, and local MCP processes may retain the permissions
of the account that started Swarmcrews. Review the effective policy and the
workspace-owned `mcp-servers.json` before launching unattended sessions.

## Troubleshooting

**"claude: command not found"**
Install Claude Code and sign in: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

**Sessions fail to start**
Make sure `claude` works on its own first — run `claude` in your terminal to verify authentication.

**Codex sessions report missing credentials**
Run `codex login`, or start Swarmcrews with `CODEX_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
available in the server environment.

**OpenCode or Pi does not appear with models**
Run `opencode models` or `pi --list-models` in the project directory. Swarmcrews
shows the effective catalog returned by that command. Set `OPENCODE_PATH` or
`PI_PATH` when the executable is not on the server's `PATH`.

**Port already in use**
Another instance may be running. Kill it or use a different port: `PORT=3142 pnpm start`

**Native module build errors during `pnpm install`**
`better-sqlite3` 13 bundles native binaries for supported platforms, including Windows x64. The project's pnpm configuration skips its unnecessary implicit `node-gyp rebuild`; `esbuild` remains allowed to run its install script. If an older checkout fails while looking for Visual Studio or a C++ compiler, update the checkout and run `pnpm install` again.

**Cannot find package `tsx`**
Run `pnpm install` successfully before starting Swarmcrews or running `pnpm preflight`. This error usually means dependencies have not been installed yet.

Startup commands now check for missing local dependencies and print `Run pnpm install` before launching. The Windows CI job runs a frozen-lockfile install with native compilation disabled, then checks startup diagnostics and SQLite database creation, writes, and reads. Run those checks locally with `pnpm test:install` and `pnpm test:sqlite`.
