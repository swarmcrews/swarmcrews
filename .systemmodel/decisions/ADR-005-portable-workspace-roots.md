# Separate portable workspace identity, source, state, and execution roots

## Context

Encoding a repository path as project identity tied persisted state to one host layout, wrote Swarmcrews metadata into repositories, and excluded legitimate mounted-volume sources. Git worktrees also answer a different question from process sandboxing: they separate change sets but do not constrain what an agent process can read, write, approve, or reach over the network.

## Decision

An explicitly registered workspace receives an opaque stable UUID. The server—not clients—maps that UUID to a canonical `sourceRoot` and to `MINIONS_HOME/workspaces/<uuid>` as its `stateRoot`. New SQLite state, settings, skills, MCP definitions, and execution worktrees live below the state root; worktrees use `<stateRoot>/worktrees`. Source roots may be on arbitrary mounted volumes, but location never grants authority: registration, canonicalization, owned-root checks, traversal rejection, and symlink-escape rejection remain mandatory.

On first registration, one unambiguous UUID from a legacy workspace descriptor or project database is preserved. Existing `<sourceRoot>/.minions` content is then copied without following symlinks and without overwriting destination files; it is never a live persistence fallback. Existing `<sourceRoot>/.canvas-worktrees` paths remain recognized for migration and cleanup, while new worktrees use the central execution root. Migration is non-destructive; legacy data is not automatically deleted.

Modern launch and WorkItem creation commands carry only the opaque workspace UUID. The server resolves the current source root. Repository moves use an explicit rebind operation. Copies receive a new UUID by default; an explicit attachment may select an existing UUID and retires the copy's automatic binding without deleting either central state directory. Editable nicknames are registry metadata and do not participate in authorization.

Git change mode and process sandbox policy remain separate. Sandbox requests always specify filesystem scope, approval policy, and network access. Plan mode forces read-only; ordinary authorized roots default to workspace-write; unrestricted access requires an explicit request. Codex enforces all three axes. Other harnesses report axes they cannot enforce as `unmanaged` rather than inheriting or implying a guarantee.

## Consequences and tradeoffs

- Repositories and mounted sources remain portable and free of newly created Swarmcrews state.
- Stable UUID routes no longer expose or depend on source path encoding.
- Central state needs backup and retention handling separate from source repositories.
- During migration, central and legacy roots coexist, so ownership checks must accept only the two known roots and must never delete legacy data merely because import succeeded.
- A requested policy is not itself a security guarantee; callers and UI must use the effective, harness-resolved policy.
