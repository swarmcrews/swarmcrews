/**
 * Architecture fitness — no test writes to the developer's real home dir.
 *
 * `server/project-store.ts` captures `os.homedir()` at module-load time.
 * Any test that imports it (transitively) and exercises `addRecentProject`
 * will land entries in the real `~/.minions/recent-projects.json`
 * unless `node:os` is mocked first.
 *
 * Concretely: contract tests that mount `server/routes/projects/core.ts`
 * (which calls `addRecentProject`) MUST install a `vi.mock("node:os", …)`
 * factory that swaps `homedir()` for a tmpdir. Otherwise a contract suite can
 * create phantom projects in the user's recent list and live app UI.
 *
 * This test enforces the invariant by walking every file under
 * `tests/contracts/` and `tests/harness/` and asserting:
 *
 *   IF the file imports `mountCoreRoutes` from `server/routes/projects/core.ts`
 *      OR imports `addRecentProject` / `removeRecentProject` directly,
 *   THEN the file MUST also contain a `vi.mock("node:os"` factory.
 *
 * The check is intentionally textual — fast, no AST traversal needed.
 * False positives are easy to silence by adding the mock; false negatives
 * (a test smuggling in a write through some other path) are out of scope
 * here and would surface as user-visible pollution.
