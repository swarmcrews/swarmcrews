/**
 * Client adapter for the shared, code-authored skill presets.
 *
 * The single source of truth for these presets is `shared/skill-presets.ts`
 * (also consumed server-side for minion arming and the leader arming
 * inventory). Here we adapt them to the client `SkillTemplate` shape and mark
 * them `builtIn: true` so the UI can:
 *   - surface them in every skill picker (desktop + mobile), and
 *   - treat them as read-only: never persisted to `$SWARMCREWS_HOME/workspaces/<uuid>/skills.json`,
 *     not deletable (editing creates a project override instead).
 *
 * `SkillPreset` is structurally identical to `SkillTemplate` (the type trees
 * are hand-mirrored because cross-tree imports between `shared/` consumers are
 * intentionally minimal), so the spread below is a safe adaptation.
