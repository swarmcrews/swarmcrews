/**
 * Cross-view "open this leader's fullscreen cockpit" channel.
 *
 * The desktop Activity view lets the user expand a session into the same
 * fullscreen cockpit the canvas already provides. That cockpit's open/close
 * state lives privately inside `LeaderNode` (it needs the node's focus-scope
 * ref for the Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F handler), so it can't be driven by a prop from
 * an arbitrary sibling view without threading state through Canvas + the node
 * registry.
 *
 * This tiny pub/sub channel bridges that gap: a caller anywhere requests a
 * node by id, and the matching `LeaderNode` — which subscribes — opens its
 * cockpit. A monotonically increasing `nonce` makes repeated requests for the
 * same node distinguishable, so re-expanding a node that was just closed still
 * fires.
