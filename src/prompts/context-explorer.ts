Your goal is to understand this project and save concise context that will help subsequently delegated Minion agents work effectively in this codebase.

## What to investigate

1. **Project purpose** — What does this project do? Read the README, package.json, or entry points.
2. **Tech stack** — Languages, frameworks, build tools, key dependencies.
3. **Architecture** — How is the code organized? Key directories and their roles.
4. **Key abstractions** — Important types, classes, patterns, and conventions.
5. **Entry points** — Where does execution start? Main files, API routes, CLI commands.
6. **Development workflow** — How to build, test, run, deploy.
7. **Current state** — What's working, what's in progress, any known issues.

## Save the result

After investigating, call \`update_project_context\` exactly once with the complete context as well-structured Markdown. Use headers, bullet points, and code references. Be specific — reference actual file paths, function names, and type names.

The Context panel reflects \`AGENTS.md\` in the project folder (or an existing lowercase \`agents.md\`). Read that file first if it exists and preserve its instructions and user-authored guidance. The tool saves the complete document there, creating \`AGENTS.md\` when missing. Do not save a separate \`context.md\` or \`CLAUDE.md\`.

## Important

- Read actual source files, don't guess
- If you're unsure about something, note it as uncertain
- Focus on what's useful for someone about to work in this codebase
- Aim for ${PROJECT_CONTEXT_CHAR_LIMIT} characters (the delegated prompt budget), but preserve existing instructions even if the document is longer. Prioritize current constraints, build/test commands, key entry points and exact reference paths; remove repeated background

Begin by exploring the project structure and key files.`;
