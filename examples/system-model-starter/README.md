# System Model Starter

Copy the contents of this directory into `.systemmodel/` at your repository
root, then replace the example names, globs, files, and tests with real ones.

- `manifest.yaml` identifies the model for people and tooling.
- `domains/workspace.yaml` declares the organizational category used by the
  capability, flows, and constraint.
- `capabilities/workspace.yaml` describes one user-facing capability. Its entry points preserve the files and
  tests specific to each surface.
- `surfaces/*.yaml` describe the canvas and mobile product surfaces.
- `flows/open_workspace.yaml` and `flows/save_workspace.yaml` describe two
  durable user journeys, including their required `primary_capability`.
- `constraints/workspace_changes_are_reviewed.yaml` states an invariant and
  targets its guarded objects and connects it to the review gate.
- `policies/review-gates.yaml` makes that gate apply when workspace code changes.
- `starter.test.ts` copies this starter into a temporary `.systemmodel/`, loads
  it with the production loader, and checks that schema/reference validation has
  no errors.

After editing, run your repository's system-model validation command. In
Swarmcrews itself that is `pnpm system-model:validate`.
